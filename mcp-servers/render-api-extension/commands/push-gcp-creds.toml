I need to push GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON to a Render service and update the healthCheckPath.

Steps:
1. First list my services with render_list_services so I can pick one
2. Ask me for the Google credentials JSON content
3. Ask me for the health check path (default: /health)
4. Use render_configure_and_deploy to:
   - Set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON environment variable
   - Update healthCheckPath
   - Trigger deployment

This will apply all changes instantly without manual dashboard intervention.
