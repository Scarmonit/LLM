Help me configure and deploy a Render service. I want to:
1. Set environment variables (especially for credentials like GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON)
2. Update service configuration (like healthCheckPath)
3. Deploy the changes immediately

First, ask me for:
- The service ID (or list services with render_list_services if I don't know it)
- Which environment variables to set
- Any configuration changes (healthCheckPath, startCommand, etc.)

Then use render_configure_and_deploy to make all changes and deploy in one action.
